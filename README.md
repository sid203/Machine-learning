What is it?
-----------

This repository consists of three projects implemented in MATLAB. Refer to the following mentioned folder names.

1.ANN-
Implements Artificial Neural Networks to recognize Handwritten digits. Run ann.m file to see it work.

2.Logistic Regression-
Using Multi-Class Classification(One-vs-all), this program aims to recognize handwritten digits as well. Run logsiticregression.m file.(ignore the spelling mistake :p)

3.Linear Regression-
Multivariate Regression model with regularization model, to predict admission of a student.Run lr.m and lr_regularized.m.

Essential Features-
1. Vectorized approach

Installation
-------------

Installation is easy as these are .m files so just download these folders to your MATLAB directory.
