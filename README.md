# Machine-learning

Hi Everyone, 

I have implemented some of popular Machine learning algorithms Linear Regression, Logistic Regression and Artificial Neural Networks. I have done this by taking help from some MOOCs specifically Andrew Ng's Machine Learning|Stanford University provided on Coursera. I can't say the whole code is mine but almost all of the important functions of the algorithms have been implemented by me. Even coursera grades you only if you are able to implement these functions. Only a few lines of code have been written by Coursera, rest all is by me. 

My aim is to make these algorithms available to the students. I have tried to keep my code simple so that readers understand these algorithms. Throughout the code i have used the concept of Vectorization i.e. all the mathematical formulaes involving nested loops have been implemented in a single line using matrix computations. Furthermore, the code is flexible enough to work for any application, only the input data matrix needs to be modified according to user application. 

That's it. Thanks for reading. Cheers !
