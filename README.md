What is it?
-----------

This repository consists of three projects implemented in MATLAB. Refer to the following mentioned folder names.

1.ANN-
Implements Artificial Neural Networks to recognize Handwritten digits. Run ann.m file to see it work.

2.Logistic Regression-
Using Multi-Class Classification(One-vs-all), this program aims to recognize handwritten digits as well. Run logsiticregression.m file.(ignore the spelling mistake :p)

3.Linear Regression-
Multivariate Regression model with regularization model, to predict admission of a student.Run lr.m and lr_regularized.m.

4.Spam Classification-
Identifies spam, not spam using svm. Run spam.m file

5.Decision Boundaries using SVM
Plots descision boundaries, segregates data using svm approach for datasets1,2,3. Run svm.m

6.Test errors
Generates error vector on test set and cross-validation sets for Logistic Regression data.


Essential Features-
1. Vectorized approach

Installation
-------------

Installation is easy as these are .m files so just download these folders to your MATLAB directory.
